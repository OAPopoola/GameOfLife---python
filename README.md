# GameOfLife---python
simple implementation of the game
I had to write some simple code for this game. This is what I have done so far. I will continue to work on it.
Next steps include

coding the unit test for the program
coding a visual representation for the board at any point in time i.e plot the board etc
coding an infinite loop where the results of each iteration becomes the seed for the next one.
